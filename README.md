# The Move Language

Move is a new programmable platform for blockchains and other applications
where safety and correctness are paramount. It is an executable bytecode language
designed to provide safe and verifiable transaction-oriented computation.
The language features a strong type system with linear resource types, runtime checks,
and formal verification. 

The implementation of Move is currently embedded in the `language` directory
within the [Diem project](https://github.com/diem/diem), and this repository is
only used to publish the Move language documentation.
